# OIL AND GAS CARBON EMISSIONS DASHBOARD
# CARBON FOOTPRINT ANALYSIS AND REDUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS (2019 - 2023)

 The analysis identifies key emission sources, trends, and areas for potential reduction, offering insights to support the company's net zero objectives and sustainable practices.

### DATA
The data for this project was generated using generative AI, resulting in a dataset with 130 rows and 4 columns: "Emission Source," "Unit," "Emission," and "Data Year." To enhance the dataset, I manually inputted the scope for each emission source, expanding the dataset to 5 columns.
To further refine the data, I filtered out the Scope 3 emissions and categorized them into "Upstream" and "Downstream" categories. The data was then formatted using Power Query in Excel, facilitating easy visualization and analysis. This preparation ensures that the dataset is well-structured and ready for comprehensive analysis and reporting.
